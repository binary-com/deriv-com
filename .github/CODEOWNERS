# ==================================================================================
# ==================================================================================
#
#  Configuration of code ownership and review approvals for the binary-com/deriv-com repo.
#
#  More info: https://help.github.com/articles/about-codeowners/
#


# ================================================
#  General rules / philosophy
# ================================================
#
#  - We trust that people do the right thing and not approve changes they don't feel confident reviewing
#  - We use github teams so that we funnel code reviews to the most appropriate reviewer, this is why the team structure is fine-grained
#  - We enforce that only approved PRs get merged to ensure that unreviewed code doesn't get accidentally merged
#  - We delegate approval rights as much as possible so that we can scale better
#  - Each group must have at least one person, but several people are preferable to avoid a single point of failure issues
#
#  Configuration nuances:
#
#  - This configuration works in conjunction with the protected branch settings that require all changes to be made via pull requests with at least one approval.
#  - This approval can come from an appropriate codeowner, or any repo collaborator (person with write access) if the PR is authored by a codeowner.
#  - Each codeowners team must have write access to the repo, otherwise their reviews won't count.
#
#  In the case of emergency, the repo administrators can bypass this requirement.
