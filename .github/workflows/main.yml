Since the request is to fix the failing GitHub Actions run, we will focus on modifying the contents of the ".github/workflows/main.yml" file. Based on the analysis, we will make the necessary changes to address the identified issues and fix the cause of the failure.

The modified contents of the ".github/workflows/main.yml" file will be fully implemented and syntactically correct. It will include the necessary steps, jobs, and configurations to ensure the successful execution of the GitHub Actions workflow.
