    git checkout -b [_your_branch_name]
    ```

        brew tap crowdin/crowdin
        brew install crowdin
        ```

    -   Set up your Crowdin API KEY in your .bash_profile or .zshrc

-   To upload source text to Crowdin (When task merge to crowdin branch)

    ```sh
    npm run translate:upload
    ```

-   To download/get the latest Crowdin translations

    ```sh
    npm run translate:download
    ```

**Note**: Don't forget to create a pull request to update crowdin branch

## Manage releases

There are 2 types of releases:

1. Release to staging:

Merging to master (squash and merge) will automatically release the last commit to the staging server https://staging.deriv.com

⚠️ If you want to release Crowdin changes, please make a PR from crowdin to master branch

2. Release to production:

Releasing to production requires a tag using the following format:

`production_VYYYYMMDD_${Integer}` --- Integer is the release version

Example of release steps

-   Create the tag following today's date

    ```sh
    git tag production_V20200806_0 -m 'release to production'
    ```

-   Push the tag to the main repository

    ```sh
    git push upstream production_V20200806_0
    ```

## Test link deployment

There are two types of test link deployment preview:

1. Automatic deployment

Upon creating PR, [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) will auto-generate a test link inside the PR. you can use that to preview the test link for the changes you have made.

2. Manual deployment

If preferable to use manual deployment, you can use [gh-pages](https://pages.github.com/) functionality to create a test link. here are ways to do it:

-   **Basic name.github.io/deriv-com/**

    ```sh
    npm run deploy-dev
    ```

    ⚠️ This will remove your branch deployments

-   **To a specific branch:**

    ```sh
    branch_name=fix_all_the_bugs npm run deploy-branch
    ```

    This will be deployed to name.github.io/deriv-com/br/fix_all_the_bugs

⚠️ You have to enable pathPrefix in gatsby-config for manual deployment, otherwise, the resources will not be uploaded to the site
