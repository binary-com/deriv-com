## Pre-installation

Before running or contribute to this project, you need to have the following packages setup in your environment

-   node
-   npm
-   git (for `contribution`)
-   gatsby-cli (npm install -g gatsby-cli)

Moreover, having these extensions will help you to speed up the development process and adhere to the best practices

-   Prettier: setup in your editor https://prettier.io/ (or you can run `npm run format`)
-   Stylelint: setup in your editor https://stylelint.io/ (or you can run `npm run stylelint`)
-   Eslint: setup in your editor https://eslint.org/ (or you can run `npm run eslint`)

## Quick start

1.  **Install your dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm ci
    ```

2.  **To start developing:**

    ```sh
    npm start
    ```

3.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

1. Create branch from latest master branch

    ```sh
    git checkout master
    git pull upstream master
    git checkout -b [_your_branch_name]
    ```

2. MAKE YOUR CHANGES

3. Make pull request

-   Push your changes to your origin

    ```sh
    git push -u origin [_your_branch_name]
    ```

-   Click on the autogenerated link from terminal to open the PR

-   Make sure to change the PR base to `master` branch

### Base crowdin

PR will be based on crowdin branch if the commits are having text changes

1. Create branch from latest crowdin branch

-   if you dont have crowdin branch

    ```sh
    git fetch upstream crowdin
    git checkout crowdin
    git checkout -b [_your_branch_name]
    ```

-   if you have crowdin branch

    ```sh
    git checkout crowdin
    git pull upstream crowdin
    git checkout -b [_your_branch_name]
    ```

2. MAKE YOUR CHANGES

3. Extract translation

-   Make sure you have the latest crowdin changes, resolve conflicts if any

    ```sh
    git pull upstream crowdin
    ```

-   Extract translation text to update `messages.json`

    ```sh
    npm run translate:extract
    ```

-   Commit your changes

4. Make pull request

-   Push your changes to your origin, add `-u` flag for the first time push

    ```sh
    git push -u origin [_your_branch_name]
    ```

-   Click on the autogenerated link from terminal to open the PR

-   Make sure to change the PR base to `crowdin` branch

## Manage translations

Pre-requisite:

-   Install crowdin-cli

    ```sh
    brew tap crowdin/crowdin
    brew install crowdin
    ```

-   To upload source text to crowdin (When task merge to crowdin branch)

    ```sh
    npm run translate:upload
    ```

-   To download/get latest crowdin translations
    ```sh
    npm run translate:upload
    ```

Note\*: Don't forget to create a pull request to update crowdin branch

## Manage releases

There are 2 types of releases:

1. Release to staging:

Merging to master (squash and merge) will automatically release last commit to staging server https://staging.deriv.com

⚠️ If you want to release crowdin change, please make a PR from crowdin to master branch

2. Release to production:

Releasing to production require a tag using the following format:

`production_VYYYYMMDD_${Integer}` --- Integer is the release version

Example of release steps

-   Create the tag following todays date

    ```sh
    git tag production_V20200806_0 -m 'release to production'
    ```

-   Push tag to main repository

    ```sh
    git push upstream production_V20200806_0
    ```

## Test link deployment

There are two types of test link deployment preview:

1. Automatic deployment

Upon creating PR, `vercel` (https://vercel.com/) will auto-generate test link inside the PR. you can use that to preview test link for the changes you have made.

2. Manual deployment

If preferrable to use manual deployment, you can use gh-pages functionality to create test link. here are ways to do it:

-   **Basic name.github.io/deriv-com/**

    ```sh
    npm run deploy-dev
    ```

    ⚠️ This will remove your branch deployments

-   **To a specific branch:**

    ```sh
    branch_name=fix_all_the_bugs npm run deploy-branch
    ```

    This will be deployed to name.github.io/deriv-com/br/fix_all_the_bugs

⚠️ You have to enable pathPrefix in gatsby-config for manual deployment, otherwise the resources will not be uploaded to the site
