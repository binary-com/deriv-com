  "_t_Stop loss_t_": "-843831637",

  "_t_Stop loss with Crash/Boom/Range break indices_t_": "-958804830",
  "_t_Stop loss works slightly differently in Crash/Boom/Range break indices.

When the market price exceeds your stop loss amount, your contract will be automatically closed at that point, instead of exactly at the stop loss level._t_": "602265590",
