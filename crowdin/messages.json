Reasons for differences in feed providers include:","-361360599":"For forex: The forex market is an OTC (over the counter) market, where banks and other major financial institutions trade currencies amongst themselves without there being any central clearing house. Accordingly, there is no 'official' price source for forex quotes. Different data feeds will contain quotes from a different sub-set of international banks. As a result, prices may differ among providers, depending on which bank(s) they obtain prices from.","-198888324":"Use of Bid/Ask: When the market is illiquid, the data feed may contain many bid and ask prices, without there actually being any traded price for quite a while. By taking an average of the bid/ask price (i.e. bid + ask, divided by 2), a market quote is generated that reflects the current market, without it actually being a traded price. Our system will generate prices from these bid and ask prices, whereas other websites might not. As a result, Our website might display ticks that do not appear in the data feeds of other websites.","-1176325047":"Please note that weekend quotes are ignored for the purpose of trade settlement. During weekends, the forex markets may occasionally generate prices; however, these prices are often artificial (traders sometimes take advantage of the illiquidity of the markets during weekends to push prices up or down). To avoid settling prices based on such artificial prices, it is Our policy not to count weekend prices towards trade settlement values (except for Volatility Indices, which are open during weekends).","-1678106216":"The services offered on Deriv are only suitable for you if you are able to bear the loss of all the money you invest and if you understand and have experienced the risks involved in the acquisition of such trades.
